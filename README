About Viewshare
===============

Viewshare is an open source web application for generating and customizing unique,
dynamic views through which users can experience cultural heritage digital
collections. The intended users of Viewshare are individuals managing and
creating access to digital collections of cultural heritage materials.

Development on Viewshare ceased in 2018.

The Viewshare Web Site
=============
The National Digital Information Infrastructure and Preservation Program at the
Library of Congress formerly hosted an instance of viewshare on a public website.
NDIIPP is no longer an active program at the Library, and the Viewshare service was
retired in March of 2018. For more information about Viewshare, see
