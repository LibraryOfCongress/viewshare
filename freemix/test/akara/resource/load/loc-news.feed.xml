That was fiction, but the real story and the &quot;reel&quot; story merge a little when the &quot;Book of Secrets&quot; movie prop and a bonus feature about the Library and its formidable collections went on display this summer in the South Orientation Gallery on the first floor of the Thomas Jefferson Building.
