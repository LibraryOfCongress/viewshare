			<description>It is very important that the ICT Strategies and Policies of India and other countries must not only be suitable but should also believe in a “holistic application and implementation”. The use of ICT has a social aspect as well. India being a Welfare State, the social structure cannot be given a complete go bye. This makes the analysis of ground reality of India inevitable keeping in mind the socio-economic, political and social conditions prevailing in India. The biggest problem with Indian ICT strategies and policies is that “localisation” and “Indianisation” are missing. We cannot blindly adopt and superimpose foreign models and ideas. They are bound to be a big flop show if we ignore the grass-root problems existing in India. Emphasis must be laid down upon solving the local problems by using local solutions.</description><link>http://legalnewsandviews.blogspot.com/2008/11/digital-preservation-in-india-hurdles.html</link></item><item><title>DPE Community on Facebook!</title>

			<description>Increasing computing capabilities for the production of Earth system model data has created new challenges for its long-term archiving and preservation.  Not all the data produced on the system can be stored in the long-term archive. A new archive concept developed by the ICSU (International Council for  Science) World Data Center for Climate (WDCC) separates data storage, including an expiration date at the scientific project level, and the documented long-term archive. This new system produces a completely documented, quality checked long-term archive with a searchable data catalogue.</description><link>http://www.digitalpreservationeurope.eu/publications/briefs/preservation-of-earth-system-model-data.pdf</link></item><item><title>DPE releases a briefing paper on Preservation of Digital Audiovisual Content</title>
			<description>The audiovisual (AV) record of the 20th century is at risk, and digitisation has been a solution, which has created a new problem: preservation of digital AV content. These files have requirements (size; specific formats) that are not adequately addressed by current technology. Best practice can be recommended, but three major changes are needed.  Read the briefing paper to find out more.</description><link>http://www.digitalpreservationeurope.eu/publications/briefs/audiovisual_v3.pdf</link></item><item><title>DPE releases a briefing paper on the challenge of appraising science records</title>
			<description>Determining the value of a work of art or historical document can be difficult. Projecting that value into the future can be even more daunting. Ascertaining the current and future value of science work is just as challenging. This paper examines how the records management function of appraisal can help determine the long-term value of science records.</description><link>http://www.digitalpreservationeurope.eu/publications/briefs/faundeen.pdf</link></item><item><title>DPE releases a briefing paper on Persistent Identifiers for Cultural Heritage</title>

			<description>Digital Preservation Europe announces the release of PLATTER: a Planning Tool for Trusted Electronic Repositories. Digital repositories are entrusted by their stakeholders - depositors, funders and end-users - with the curation of vital and often irreplaceable electronic assets. Repositories typically validate that trust by subjecting themselves to audit and certification. But how should a new or existing repository organise its planning to prepare for certification? How do you plan for trust? 

DPE's PLATTER toolkit will enable new and existing repositories to plan their activities in all the key areas of repository development in order to meet their self-defined goals. PLATTER is designed to complement existing initiatives for audit and certification such as the DPE and DCC  DRAMBORA toolkit.</description><link>http://www.digitalpreservationeurope.eu/publications/reports/Repository_Planning_Checklist_and_Guidance.pdf</link></item><item><title>Preserving the future - cutting edge digital preservation techniques showcased by DPE, CASPAR, nestor and Planets at CeBIT 4-9 March 2008</title>

The latest digital preservation research and technology developments and their relevance to the industry were showcased at the tand 'WePreserve - European Digital Preservation Initiatives' by DPE, CASPAR, nestor and Planets at CeBIT 4-9 March 2008.
The event was a great success for the four projects and generated a great deal of interest within the business community, the general public and also the German Government. Among the many visitors to the 'WePreserve' stand was Bern Neumann, German Minister of State to the Federal Chancellor and Federal Government Commissioner for Culture and the Media, pictured above with Emily Witham.
The experts from each of the projects were on hand throughout the week to demonstrate prototype software tools which can help organisations address core digital preservation challenges to visitors. In addition a number of presentations were given in the convention centre to provide a more in depth view of digital preservation issues and the work currently underway by the partners.
DPE, Planets and CASPAR are strategic projects co-funded by the European Union under its Sixth Framework Programme. nestor, the German network of expertise in long-term digital preservation, is a cooperative project funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research.</description><link>http://www.digitalpreservationeurope.eu/events/cebit-2008/</link></item><item><title>DPE Position Paper: Ross Harvey 'So Where is the Black Hole in our Collective Memory?</title>
			<description>DigitalPreservationEurope is pleased to announce the release of the second in a series of thought provoking and controversial position papers on a range of issues surrounding digital preservation, &lt;i&gt;So Where is the Black Hole in our Collective Memory&lt;/i&gt;? It is our intention that these papers will promote vigorous debate within the digital preservation community and encourage people to think about digital preservation in new and innovative ways by exploring and challenging the received wisdom.
Harvey's position paper asks the important question, Have the digital preservation community cried wolf too often? Are our strident, alarmist proclamations about the loss of digital materials too extreme? He argues that our inability to bring evidence to bear in support of such claims leave us exposed and easily overlooked.

			<description>Research and teaching is not possible without reliable access to the accumulated scholarship of the past and secure preservation of the scholarly record. In the print world preservation responsibility was linked to ownership and was traditionally a function of the library. In the digital age, however, the link between ownership, preservation, and access is broken. By supporting collaborative efforts such as Portico, libraries and publishers can together contribute toward a shared infrastructure which supports a mutually beneficial and valued goal - the long-term, robust preservation of scholarly literature published in electronic form.</description><link>http://www.digitalpreservationeurope.eu/publications/portico_briefing_paper_def.pdf</link></item><item><title>DPE Position Papers</title>

			<description>The focus of this paper is the legal framework for the management of content
of cooperating repositories. The focus will be on the regulation of copyright and protection of personal data.

That copyright is important when managing data repositories is common knowledge. However, there is an increasing tendency among authors  not only to deposit their published scientific work, scientific articles, dissertations or books, but also the underlying data. In addition to this ordinary publicly available sources like internet web pages contain personal data, often of a sensitive nature. Due to this emergent trend repositories will have to comply with the rules governing the use and protection of personal data, especially in the medical and social sciences.</description><link>http://www.digitalpreservationeurope.eu/publications/PO3_4_LegalFramework.pdf</link></item><item><title>DPE, PLANETS, and CASPAR Second Annual Conference: Presentations now available</title>
